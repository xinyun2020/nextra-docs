## Zettelkasten - How to use it?

This is Xinyun's personal knowledge base. I use it to store my notes, ideas, and resources publicly.

- 01-Fleeting notes
  - Fleeting notes are temporary reminders of ideas.
- 02-Literature notes
  - fleeting notes and pick out the ideas that you really want to keep
  - One idea per note
  - One Source
- 03-Permanent notes/Summary notes
  - Multiple sources
- 04-Index notes
  - a cluster of related permanent notes
  - outline for an article
- 05-Keyword notes
  - with tag
  - table of contents for a book or entry

## Structure logics

- **Folders** are named in [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) format - optimizing for
  - P - near-term projects I want to do (Deadline)
  - A - standards I want to upkeep
  - R - resources for stuff I like
  - Z - Draft to clean up
  - Archive - for misc past junk I don't see myself needing any more
- STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, and Result) #goal
- OKR methodology (Objectives and Key Results) #goal
