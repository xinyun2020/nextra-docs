# About

My name is Alice, a software engineer based in Australia. I recently finishing a master's degree in Data Science. I started exploring computers and programming during my software engineering bachelor's degree.

After working as a software engineer in business, I found myself wanting to explore more in AI and NLP, to be able to combine my knowledge to create greater products.
